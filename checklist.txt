- Make everything in the MonkeyID section configurable
  per server
    - Auth channel [DONE]
    - Story channel [DONE]
    - Report channel [DONE]
    - Bad word list [DONE]
    - Log blacklist [DONE]
    - Story archives [DONE]

- Check if the user has admin perms instead of checking

- Make surveys per-server [DONE]

- Make stories per-server [DONE]

- Make it so you can't see logs from other servers, and
  also disable checking them through DMs [DONE]

- As this bot will be working with multiple servers, DM
  commands will no longer work, so disable those or the
  bot will probably crash [DONE]

  server [DONE]

- Add failsafe in case bot does not make a new config
  when added to a new server (if it's shut off, for instance) [DONE, UNTESTED]

  based on infixations (or at least make it an option)

- Make pretty much every global var per-server
